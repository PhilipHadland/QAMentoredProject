# QAMentoredProject

* Why are we doing this?
The project was designed to see if we could put into action the things we've learned, and also to see if we were able to learn Bootstrap/CSS with no formal training. 

* How I expected the challenge to go.
I expected the challenge to go well but was unsure about Bootstrap and CSS as I haven't used them much before.

* What went well?
I enjoyed thinking through the logic for each step and it was interesting to play around with Bootstrap and CSS.

* What didn't go as planned?
I don't think the code is very clean so to an outsider it may not be very clear, but I don't think this is an issue for this project because it was more about the learning. Now that I've done it once I'll know how to layout it out cleaner. My design is also very basic so I need to work on my creativity skills.

* Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
No improvements, was a fun challenge.
